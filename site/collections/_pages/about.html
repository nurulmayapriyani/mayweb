      <p>Hi. Welcome to my website. My name is Nurul May Apriyani. I'm Junior
      Software Developer from Indonesia.</p><p>I graduated as diploma majoring
      Business Administration at LP3I, but then I learnt Fullstack Web
      Development at Purwadhika.</p><p>I switched my career as
      Software Developer because I want to work where I can grow along the time
      and I'd love to create or build something. Even though errors or bugs
      always happen in the process of development, but at the end all those
      problems will be replaced by the satisfied feeling I'd
      gain.</p><p>I'm currently working full-time as a Front-end Developer specializing in React.js development.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
