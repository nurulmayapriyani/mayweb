Without any account login, we still could see the products in home page. And these are the options of filter category.

![](/uploads/artsycraftial-sort.png){: width="1893" height="749"}

These are the options of sort feature.

![](/uploads/artsycraftial-filter-search.png){: width="1903" height="733"}

This is how the search feature works.

![](/uploads/artsycraftial-product-detail.png){: width="1899" height="903"}

And this is how the product detail looks like.

![](/uploads/artsycraftial-login.png){: width="1899" height="890"}

If there is no account logged in, Add to Cart button will redirect us to the login page.

![](/uploads/artsycraftial-register.png){: width="1899" height="890"}

If we haven't made an account, we can register an account on register page.

![](/uploads/artsycraftial-add-to-cart.png){: width="1904" height="883"}

There is a success alert if we are successful to add any product to our cart page.

If we click Checkout button there will be another table show up to fill informations about the recipient. And also there is a column to input amount of money to pay the transaction.

If we input amount of money less than the Total Price, there will be a warning alert. We could reinput the amount of money by clicking Ok. 

![](/uploads/artsycraftial-payment-success.png){: width="1899" height="893"}

If the amount of money at least meets the Total Price, there will be a successful alert.

![](/uploads/artsycraftial-history.png){: width="1899" height="893"}

We could see our history transactions in history page.

![](/uploads/artsycraftial-history-detail.png){: width="1899" height="893"}

If we click See Details button there will be a table show up containing details of the transaction.

![](/uploads/artsycraftial-admin.png){: width="1899" height="893"}

If we logged in as admin, there will be Product Lists in admin page.

![](/uploads/artsycraftial-admin-filter.png){: width="1899" height="893"}

We could do search in Filter column to find any product.

![](/uploads/artsycraftial-admin-edit.png){: width="1899" height="893"}

We could edit each product by clicking Edit button. And we could save the modification by clicking Save button.

![](/uploads/artsycraftial-admin-edit-done.png){: width="1899" height="893"}

After we click Save button, the modification will be applied to the product.

We could add a product by filling the columns below the product lists then click Add Product button.

![](/uploads/artsycraftial-admin-add-done.png){: width="1899" height="893"}

After we click Add Product button, the added product will show up in the last page and the last row.
