Activate Multi-Factor Authentication in My Profile menu will appear when user logged in with OTP 0 (MFA is nonactive). This button will change from OTP 0 to OTP 1 (MFA is nonactive but must activate), logout automatically, and redirect to login page.

Valid code response of Multi-Factor Authentication Activation

Multi-Factor Authentication Activation page will appear when user logged in with OTP 1. This page will show up right after login page (that's why OTP 1 must activate). User will need to scan the QR Code with Authenticator App and enter one-time code from the Authenticator App. The Authenticator App will always have one-time code every 30 seconds, that will be used for the next login. This page will change from OTP 1 to OTP 2 (MFA is active).

After successfully activated MFA, user with OTP 2 will redirect to home page. User will see Nonactivate Multi-Factor Authentication in My Profile menu. This button will change from OTP 2 to OTP 1, logout automatically, and redirect to login page. So that user must activate MFA again in the next login by scanning QR Code and entering one-time code from Authenticator App.

Invalid code response of Multi-Factor Authentication Validation

After successfully activated MFA, in the next login, user with OTP 2 will see validation page right after login. User will need to enter the one-time code from the Authenticator App. If the code is valid, user will redirect to home page. And user will also see Nonactivate Multi-Factor Authentication in My Profile menu.
