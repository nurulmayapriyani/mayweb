Activate Multi-Factor Authentication in My Profile menu will appear when user logged in with OTP 0 (MFA is nonactive). This button will change from OTP 0 to OTP 1 (MFA is nonactive but must activate), logout automatically, and redirect to login page.

Invalid code response of Multi-Factor Authentication Activation
<br>(invalid code will make error alert show up and disable the button, to make the button enable again click close (x) on the error alert)

Valid code response of Multi-Factor Authentication Activation
<br>(valid code will make successful alert show up before redirect to home page)

Multi-Factor Authentication Activation page will appear when user logged in with OTP 1. This page will show up right after login page (that's why OTP 1 must activate). User will need to scan the QR Code with Authenticator App and enter one-time code from the Authenticator App. The one-time code in Authenticator App will be renewed in every 30 seconds, that will be used for validation in the next login. This page will change from OTP 1 to OTP 2 (MFA is active).

After successfully activated MFA, user with OTP 2 will be redirected to home page. User will see Nonactivate Multi-Factor Authentication in My Profile menu. This button will change from OTP 2 to OTP 1, logout automatically, and redirect to login page, so that user must activate MFA again in the next login by scanning QR Code and entering one-time code from Authenticator App.

Invalid code response of Multi-Factor Authentication Validation
<br>(invalid code will make error pop up show up, click "ok" to reinput the code)

After successfully activated MFA, in the next login, user with OTP 2 will see validation page right after login. User will need to enter the one-time code from the Authenticator App (that is exist after scanning QR Code in activation page, and be renewed in every 30 seconds). If the code is valid, user will be redirected to home page. User will also see Nonactivate Multi-Factor Authentication in My Profile menu.
