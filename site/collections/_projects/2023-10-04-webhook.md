Work Period of Project: 15th August 2023 - 2nd October 2023

The works I did in this Webhook feature:
![](/uploads/webhook-h2h-unchecked.jpg){: width="1893" height="749"}

Get NPWP, Name, and Email from logged in user in core project.

![](/uploads/webhook-h2h-checked.jpg){: width="1893" height="749"}

Hide and show further form based on checkbox clicked.

![](/uploads/webhook-generate-clicked.jpg){: width="1903" height="733"}

![](/uploads/webhook-generate-done.jpg){: width="1903" height="733"}

Show loading effect on button when the button is clicked and show Refresh text on button once Application ID and API Key is generated. Generate text on button will only appear when user never click Generate button before. Once user have Application ID generated, the text on button will be changed to Refresh.

![](/uploads/webhook-ipserver-outoflimit.jpg){: width="1899" height="903"}

![](/uploads/webhook-ipserver-limit.jpg){: width="1899" height="893"}

The maximal limit number for IP Server input is 255, so when user type more than 255, the input will be changed to 255 once the input is not focused (user click somewhere else with the cursor).

![](/uploads/webhook-whatsapp-nonumber-input.jpg){: width="1899" height="893"}

![](/uploads/webhook-whatsapp-number-input.jpg){: width="1899" height="893"}

WhatsApp No. input column won't allow user to type other than number, so when any character or alphabet is typed, there will be a red warning written below the input column, it will be removed whenever user type any number again or delete any number.

![](/uploads/webhook-save-termcond-checked.jpg){: width="1904" height="883"}

When the checkbox of Term & Condition is clicked, the Save button will be enabled to click.

![](/uploads/webhook-save-clicked.jpg){: width="1899" height="890"}

When the Save button is clicked, there will be pop up confirmation to protect any accidental click from user.

![](/uploads/webhook-save-whatsapp-underminimal.jpg){: width="1899" height="890"}

When user confirmed Save when the WhatsApp No. has less than minimal (10 digits), it will cancel save process, make the input enabled and also show red warning written below the column. This is a bit protection to prevent user send inactive number.

![](/uploads/webhook-whatsapp-abovelimit.jpg){: width="1899" height="890"}

When user type WhatsApp No. above of maximal limit (12 digits), it will not let user to input more than the maximal limit, so it will stop when the digits are already 12 length. This is also a bit protection to prevent user send inactive number.

![](/uploads/webhook-refresh-clicked-inputenabled.jpg){: width="1899" height="890"}

![](/uploads/webhook-refresh-done-inputenabled.jpg){: width="1899" height="890"}

User is able to click Refresh button when the input is enabled, this is also same for Generate. Refresh button is made to refresh API Key while the Application ID will stay the same.

![](/uploads/webhook-save-popupconfirm.jpg){: width="1899" height="890"}

Buttons on pop up confirmation also have darker color when it's hovered/clicked, just like Save & Generate/Refresh buttons.

![](/uploads/webhook-save-confirmed.jpg){: width="1899" height="890"}

When the Save button is confirmed, the Term & Condition checkbox and input columns will be disabled and the text on Save button will be changed to Update.

![](/uploads/webhook-refresh-clicked-inputdisabled.jpg){: width="1899" height="890"}

![](/uploads/webhook-refresh-done-inputdisabled.jpg){: width="1899" height="890"}

User is also able to click Refresh button when the input is disabled.

![](/uploads/webhook-update-enabled.jpg){: width="1899" height="890"}

When user click Update while the input is disabled, it will make the input is enabled again to be typed.

![](/uploads/webhook-update-termcond-checked.jpg){: width="1899" height="890"}

The Term & Condition will also make the Update button enabled just like when it enabled Save button before.

![](/uploads/webhook-update-clicked.jpg){: width="1899" height="890"}

![](/uploads/webhook-update-popupconfirm.jpg){: width="1899" height="890"}

And just like Save button, when the Update button is clicked while the input is enabled, it will show pop up confirmation with buttons that will have darker color when it's hovered/clicked.

![](/uploads/webhook-update-confirmed.jpg){: width="1899" height="890"}

When the Update is confirmed, it will also make Term & Condition checkbox and input columns disabled. And user could edit and update again by clicking Update button.

![](/uploads/webhook-ipserver-tooltip.jpg){: width="1899" height="890"}

There is also a tooltip right after IP Server column, user could hover the question mark to get some information about the IP Server.
