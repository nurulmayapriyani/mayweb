Not even all adults can manage money. That's what I see. But school never teach us this kind of thing, even accounting major. I am personally a saver since I was a kid so it's not hard for me to have a mindset to manage money.

Financial mindset is one of main skills in life. It really is. Once you do it at first time, you will think how much money that you should have had if you did it from a long time ago. It helps a lot. It makes your life more safe.

If you have been working so many years but still not have good save maybe you should start to do your own petty cash. Because petty cash helps me to see how much amount of expense I spend every month. I suggest you also only buy things what you need and reduce amount of some expenses if it's possible. 

For more further you can invest some of your salary every month (syariah if you're muslim) to make your money work for you. And if you like to read I suggest you to read Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki.

And remember even money is not everything but we need money to live. Just don't let your mindset makes you to be stingy okay. We still have to share with poor people, because we have humanity as human.
